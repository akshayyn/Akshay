pipeline-(single processor)
Fetch-load-execute
Types of dependancies
Structural dependancy-when we ewanna store instruction anda data in diff memory(hw depend)
Data dependancies-previous step dependancy(a+b so we cant prpoceed with a+b till a and b is loaded)
control dependancy(fetch,decode-for conditional looping


techniques to make it fast
branch prediction(predoct loops) that this loop will a branch(jump)


Cache-(cache hit founbd data from cache/cache miss didnt find data/miss penalty (time for taking from main memory)
suppose 100000 ram and 1000 memory
Tyoes of mapping
Full associative(any data anywhere)-disadvt upto 1000 cycles every access(advantage if u want to access 0 10000 again n again(just 2 cycles)
direct map-Divide ram into sections and each location of cache will point to 0..1000.200......99000(so every tim only one cycle)
two way set(keep 2 set data in each loc of cache)
four way(keep 4 at any loc at cache)

Further betterment - make 2 cache instead of one
L1 cache 256kb
L2 cache


Policies for freeing cache
0 1000 2000
FIFO
suppose u have space for 2 every locati
